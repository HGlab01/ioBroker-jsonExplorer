# ioBroker JsonExplorer

## How to prepare
Create file `/lib/stateAttr.js` based on template `_template/stateAttr.js`and add  
* `const JsonExplorer = require('iobroker-jsonexplorer');`
* `const stateAttr = require(__dirname + '/lib/stateAttr.js'); // Load attribute library`  
in section "Load your modules here"  


Add line `JsonExplorer.init(this, stateAttr);` to the adapter constructor.  

## How to use
Call `await JsonExplorer.TraverseJson(result, parent, true, false);`  
result: JSON object to be addad as states  
parent: name of the parent state; null results in root  
replaceName: true|false; if yes, the description of a channel will be replaced by the name of a leaf-state if available  
replaceID: true|false; if yes, the description of a channel will be replaced by the id of a leaf-state if available  


### Expire management (optional)
All states can be monitored and set to NULL if it is not updated in the last run by calling `JsonExplorer.setLastStartTime()` before calling `JsonExplorer.TraverseJson()` and `JsonExplorer.checkExpire(parent)` after caling `JsonExplorer.TraverseJson()`
